#summary Simple game of tic-tac-toe described

Everything described in context of BoardGameParts

= Player =

Exactly two players play tic-tac-toe.  One is considered the "X" player and the other is considered the "O" player.  Which player is X and which player is O can be decided any way the players agree on.  

= Board = 

The board is a 3x3 grid often drawn without the outside boards (two vertical lines next to each other overlapped by two horizontal lines next to each other)

= Space =

The board has 9 spaces, all equal.  There is one space in the center, and then eight spaces surrounding the center space.

= Piece =

Players place either Xs or Os on the spaces depending on which player they are.

= Move =

To move, a player chooses an empty space to place an X or O piece.  Players can only place one piece during their turn and may only place the piece that they are assigned to (either X or O).

= Turn = 

A turn consists of a single move.  Normally the X player has their turn first.

= Round = 

There is no need for the concept of a round - no special actions come into play before or after everyone takes a turn.

= Rule = 

If a player has three of their pieces in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) at any one time, that player wins the game.  If all spaces are filled and neither player has three of their pieces in a row, the game is a tie.
