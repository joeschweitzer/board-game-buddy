#summary Flow of steps/calls that a game might consist of

= Setup =

  # (UI) Some way for players to find each other/communicate with each other with desire to play a game
  # Create players/wait until enough players join
  # Infrastructure
    # Create player manager and add players to player manager
    # Create empty board
    # Create board manager and add board to board manager as main/only board
    # Create move manager
    # Create turn manager
    # Create round manager
    # Create score manager
    # Create game manager
    # Create whatever connection/listeners that need to be created to facilitate communication between these managers
  # Ask turn manager who goes first
    # Turn manager asks first player manager who goes first
      # (UI) First player manager either figures this out on its own (e.g. random) or receives input from players to determine who goes first

= Game = 

    # Game manager starts game
    # Round manager starts round 1
    # Turn manager starts turn 1-1 with player 1 to move
    # (UI) Move manager waits for a move from player 1
    # Move manager receives a move from player 1 and validates it
    # Move manager executes the move from player 1
    # Turn manager ends turn 1-1
    # Turn manager starts turn 1-2 with player 2 to move
    # (UI) Move manager waits for a move from player 2
    # Move manager receives a move from player 2 and validates it
    # Move manager executes the move from player 2
    # Turn manager ends turn 1-2
    # Round manager ends round 1
    # Round manager starts round 2
    # Turn manager starts turn 2-1 with player 1 to move
    # Turn manager/round manager continue
    # After each move, score manager is consulted 
    # Score manager calculates whether or not game has been won/lost/tie and if won/lost who the winner is
    # Once score manager determines this, the game is over 

= TicTacToe Command Line Sample =

  # User A sees an empty "table" and joins
  # User B sees the table with one spot left and joins
  # Infrastructure created
    # Empty tic tac toe board with 9 spaces (3x3)
  # Turn manager randomly picks User A as Player 1 (X) and User B and Player 2 (O)
  # Game/round 1/turn 1-1 starts with player 1 to move
  # Player 1 inputs their move as placing an X on an empty space
  # Move validated, score manager consulted, turn ends, game continues with turn 1-2 and player 2 to move
  # Player 2 inputs their move as placing an O on an empty space
  # Move validated, score manager consulted, turn ends, round ends
  # Round 2/turn 2-1 starts with player 1 to move
  # ...
  # Player enters a move that either wins the game or fills up all 9 spaces with no winner (i.e. a tie)
  # Game ends
